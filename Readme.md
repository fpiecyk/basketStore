## Basket Shop
### I've created e-commerce web shop with basketball apparel. 

It's a dynamic web application built in Django. 
The application functions are:
* sign-in/log-in user module
* filter products by category and price
* pagination
* add to wishlist
* add to cart based on browser session
* place and order and check customer orders
